Asteroids Game made with processing.
To run this, open AsteroidsGame.pde with the Processing program 
and click run. Make sure all the pde files are kept in the same
directories as they are now. 

An alternative way to run the program without going through processing:
Go to applet and open the AsteroidsGame.jar file. You will need Java for this.
